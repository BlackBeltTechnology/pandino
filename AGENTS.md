## Project Overview

<!-- One-paragraph description of what this project is. -->

## Code Instructions

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common coding mistakes. Bias toward caution over
speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- Never speculate about code you have not opened. Read the file first.
- Before any major change, confirm the plan.

### 2. Simplicity First

- Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- No features beyond what was asked; no abstractions for single-use code.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- DRY: extract a shared helper when a pattern repeats; don't pre-extract for one call site.

### 3. Surgical Changes

- Touch only what you must. Match existing style.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Remove imports/variables your changes made unused; leave pre-existing dead code (mention it).
- Every changed line traces directly to the request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution (TDD)

- Turn tasks into verifiable goals with explicit success criteria.
- Write or update tests first, verify they fail, then write the minimal implementation to pass.
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with a verify step each.

### 5. Communication

- Give a high-level explanation of what changed — don't dump diffs without summary.

## OpenSpec

This project uses OpenSpec for spec-driven changes. Place change artifacts at
`openspec/changes/<name>/`. Prefer `openspec change new <name>` to scaffold.

When authoring a proposal, add a `## Discipline Skills` line to `proposal.md`
naming the `eng-disciplines` skills its tasks will trigger (mapped via the
checkpoint table below); omit only when none apply. This needs no edit to any
openspec skill — the implement loop reads the proposal artifact unchanged, so
the named skills enter its context and get invoked.

## Discipline Skills

During implementation, invoke the matching `eng-disciplines` skill when a task
signal appears. Skills auto-trigger on natural language, but the implement loop
may never utter the phrase — this table makes the mapping explicit (signals are
observable in the diff / `tasks.md`, not vague intent):

| Task signal (in diff / tasks.md) | Skill |
|---|---|
| touches auth, untrusted input, secrets, webhooks, PII | `security-hardening` |
| spec has a latency/throughput budget, or a large-data / high-traffic path | `performance-optimization` |
| new endpoint, job, external call, or "can't tell what happened in prod" | `observability-instrumentation` |
| non-trivial/irreversible step (migration, public API, cross-boundary) BEFORE it stands | `doubt-driven-review` |
| a bug surfaces mid-implementation | `systematic-debugging` |
| runtime state opaque, `console.log` insufficient | `node-inspect-debugger` |
| feature works + tests pass but the implementation feels heavy | `code-simplification` |

The end gates (`code-review`, `code-quality`) remain unchanged and run at completion before commit.
