# EventAdmin DOM TS

A TypeScript example showcasing `EventAdmin` implementation details for a Browser-based project.

We should be able to see two different Web Components communicating with each other via the `EventAdmin`.

## Setup
- Run `npm run build` in the Git Repository root
- Run `npm install` in this folder in order to update NPM links to the Pandino built sources
- Run `./cp-event-admin.sh` to copy the EventAdmin implementation as a runtime dependency

## Running the actual app
Run `npm start` to start a Webpack Dev Server

> Server will start at: http://localhost:8080
