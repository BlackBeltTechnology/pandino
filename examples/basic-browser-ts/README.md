# Basic Browser TS

A TypeScript example showcasing Pandino implementation details for a Browser-based project.

In this case not only the App it self, but our runtime Bundles are also written in TypeScript, in detached packages.

## Setup
- Run `npm run build` in the Git Repository root
- Run `npm install` in `examples/basic-browser-ts` folder in order to update NPM links to the Pandino built sources
- Run `./cp-built-dependencies.sh` in the `examples/basic-browser-ts/app` folder to obtain dependencies

## Running the actual app
Run `start` to start a web server

> Server will start at: http://localhost:5001
